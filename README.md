# weather

a simple weather app i’m planning to build.  
right now it’s **work in progress** and basically not usable yet.

## status

- project skeleton is here  
- core features are **not implemented yet**  
- expect broken or missing functionality

## goal

build a minimal app that fetches weather data for a city and shows it cleanly.

## plans

- basic search  
- show temp / humidity / wind  
- maybe a small forecast  
- nothing fancy, just a simple working tool

## note

this repo is mainly for learning and experimenting.  
check back later when there’s actual code.
